# Transactions

We need to enforce transaction limits to protect against fraud and to follow KYC (know you customer), AML (anti money laundering) and CFT (combat financing of terrorism) regulation.

Here are the limits we want to implement

- maximum transaction size: 300 GBP
- maximum number of transactions per day: 10
- maximum amount of money sent per day: 5000 GBP
- maximum number of transactions per month: 50
- maximum amount of money sent per month: 15000 GBP
